Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";
// Only change code below this line
var myFirstName = "Chris";
var myLastName = "Jim";

Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
var myStr ="I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line

Change the provided string from double to single quotes and remove the escaping.
var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.
var myStr="FirstLine\n\\SecondLine\\\rThirdLine"; // Change this line

Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
// Only change code below this line
var myStr = "This is the start. " +  "This is the end.";

Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
"This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
// Only change code below this line
var myStr = "This is the first sentence. "; 
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am swell!"
// Example
var ourName = "Free Code Camp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Chris Jim";
var myStr = "My name is" + myName + " and I am swell!";

Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "Free Code Camp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
// Only change code below this line
var someAdjective = "really fun";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective; 

Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.
// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";
firstNameLength = firstName.length;
// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";
// Only change code below this line.
lastNameLength = lastName.length;
